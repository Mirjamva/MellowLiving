  </figure>
  <p>Our co-living project, Mellow Living, is founded on the belief that a close-knit community is the key to a vibrant and fulfilling life. Our purpose is to create a healthy, safe, and caring environment that encourages deep connections, authentic expression, and shared growth for everyone involved. By fostering a strong sense of community, we aim to build a sustainable future for ourselves and the world.</p>
  <p>At the heart of Mellow Living are our core values and principles, which guide every aspect of our project:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <div class="custom-icon community"></div>
      Community: We believe in the power of human connections and strive to create an inclusive, supportive environment where everyone feels welcome, valued, and heard.
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="custom-icon sustainability"></div>
      Sustainability: We are committed to minimizing our environmental impact and fostering eco-friendly practices, both within our co-living space and in our daily lives.
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="custom-icon collaboration"></div>
      Collaboration: We recognize the potential in each individual and encourage collaboration in our co-working and DIY spaces, where residents can share their skills, knowledge, and creativity.
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="custom-icon wellbeing"></div>
      Health and Well-being: We prioritize physical, mental, and emotional well-being, providing spaces and resources for exercise, relaxation, and self-care.

  </ol>
  <p>Mellow Living offers a range of shared spaces and amenities designed to support our values and principles. Our co-working area provides a comfortable and inspiring environment for residents to work, collaborate, and network. The DIY space allows for hands-on creativity and learning, fostering a culture of innovation and self-sufficiency.</p>
  <p>Our communal garden is a living testament to our commitment to sustainability and connection to nature. Here, residents can grow their food, practice gardening techniques, and enjoy the outdoors. The garden also serves as a space for events and workshops, where residents and neighbors can come together to learn, share, and grow.</p>
  <p>Through our emphasis on community, sustainability, and well-being, Mellow Living seeks to create a nurturing, connected living experience for all our residents. We invite you to join us on this journey towards a brighter, more sustainable future.</p>
